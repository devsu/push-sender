# Push Sender #

Push Sender is a Java library that allows sending push messages easily, based on the awesome libraries [gcm-server](https://github.com/theganyo/gcm-server) by [theganyo](https://github.com/theganyo) and (java-apns)[https://github.com/notnoop/java-apns] by (notnoop)[https://github.com/notnoop]. Send push messages with one line of code, forget about the rest, and focus on making on your application's business logic!

## Overview ###

Using Push Sender is very simple. You can import Push Sender on your POM file using:

```
	<dependency>
		<groupId>com.devsu</groupId>
		<artifactId>push-sender</artifactId>
		<version>1.0.0</version>
	</dependency>
```

## Synchronous and asynchronous push services ###

You can send your push messages synchronously and asynchronously by choosing any of the implementations of `PushService`.

```java
public class MySender {

	SyncAndroidPushService syncAndroidService = new SyncAndroidPushService(GCM_API_KEY);
	AsyncAndroidPushService asyncAndroidService = new SyncAndroidPushService(GCM_API_KEY, null);
	
	SyncApplePushService syncAppleService = new SyncApplePushService(P12_FILEPATH, P12_PASSWORD, IS_PRODUCTION_ENVIRONMENT);
	AsyncApplePushService asyncAppleService = new AsyncApplePushService(P12_FILEPATH, P12_PASSWORD, IS_PRODUCTION_ENVIRONMENT, null);
	
	...
	
	public void sendSomePushMessages() {
		String title = "My Push Message Title";
		String content = "Hello! This is a push message!";
		
		syncAndroidService.sendPush(title, content, ANDROID_PUSH_TOKEN);
		asyncAndroidService.sendPush(title, content, ANDROID_PUSH_TOKEN);
		
		syncAppleService.sendPush(title, content, IOS_PUSH_TOKEN);
		asyncAppleService.sendPush(title, content, IOS_PUSH_TOKEN);
	}

	...
}
```

## PushCallback ###

You can implement a PushCallback for any of the asynchronous services.

```java
public class MySender {

	...
		
	public void sendSomePushMessages() {
		AsyncAndroidPushService asyncAndroidService = new SyncAndroidPushService(GCM_API_KEY, new PushCallback() {
			
			@Override
			public void onSingleSuccess(boolean result, String title, String message, 
					Map<String, String> additionalFields, String token) {
				System.out.println("The single message was successfully sent!");
			}
			
			@Override
			public void onError(Throwable t) {
				System.err.println("Oops... Something happened!");
			}
			
			@Override
			public void onBulkSuccess(boolean result, String title, String message, 
					Map<String, String> additionalFields, String[] tokens) {
				System.out.println("The bulk message was successfully sent!");
			}
		});
	}

	...
}
```
